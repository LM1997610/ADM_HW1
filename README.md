# Homework_1

This GitHub repository was created to submit ADM's HomeWork1.

It contains the PDF file created from the submission page of HackerRank and it's named "Submissions_HackerRank_merge.pdf"

Then there is the Python code of my solutions. This is a Jupyter Notebook file named "HW_1.ipynb".

This file is missing some solutions of exercises that I have not been able to complete. 
In particular, the exercises that are missing are:
* 3 on Strings
* 1 on Sets 
* 3 on Collections
* 4 on Regex

for a total of 11 missing exercises out of 91.


Some of the exercises in the Regex section have been solved with help of the solutions found online.
I had never worked with regular expressions before and I found them quite complicated.
However, in any case, trying to understand the request of the exercise and the procedure to get the relative solution.

Due to the RunningTime error, I had a hard times completing some of the exercises in Part 2 (Implementation of Algorithms). 
Therefore to be able to solve it and deliver them I have looked at some suggestions from the web.
