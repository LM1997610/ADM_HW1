# Homework_1

This GitHub repository was created to submit ADM's HomeWork1.

It contains the PDF file created from the submission page of HackerRank and it's named "Submissions_HackerRank_merge.pdf"

Then there is the Python code of my solutions. This is a Jupyter Notebook file named "HW_1.ipynb".
This file is missing some solutions of exercises that I have not been able to complete. 
In particular, the exercises that are missing are:
* 3 on Strings
* 1 on Sets 
* 3 on Collections
* 4 on Regex

for a total of 11 missing exercises out of 91.
