# HomeWork_1

This GitHub repository was created to submit [**Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining**](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2022)'s [**HomeWork_1**](http://aris.me/contents/teaching/data-mining-ds-2022/homeworks/homework1.pdf).

It contains the PDF file created from the submission page of [**HackerRank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/) named <u>*Submissions_HackerRank_merge.pdf*</u>

Then there is the Python code of my solutions.\
This is a Jupyter Notebook file named "HW_1.ipynb".\
This file is missing some solutions of exercises that I have not been able to complete due to the difficulty level.

In particular, the exercises that are missing are:

* 3 on Strings
* 1 on Sets 
* 3 on Collections
* 4 on Regex

for a total of 11 missing exercises out of 91.


Some of the exercises in the Regex section have been solved with help of the solutions found online.\
However, in any case, trying to understand the request of the exercise and the procedure to get the relative solution.
